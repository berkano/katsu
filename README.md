# Katsu - Java 2D Game Framework based on LibGDX

This is my personal game framework for Ludum Dare (http://ludumdare.com/compo/)
which I have been extending over time based on my needs during the compo.
It's based on LibGDX and contains the source code and assets for my latest LD entry.

Enjoy, and good luck! ~ berkano (http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/berkano/)

# Dependencies / Running

- The project was originally generated by LibGDX and relies on Gradle (of which I am an absolute beginner)
- In theory things should be IDE independent (I don't commit any IDE settings etc) but I exclusively work with IntelliJ IDEA so YMMV.
- Invoke the katsu \[run\] goal to launch the game.
- The code supports a -DdevMode=true parameter (add this to your run configuration) to enable some shortcuts/hacks/debug features while developing.

# Mac development with IntelliJ IDEA

- Tested under Yosemite + IntelliJ IDEA 14 + JDK 7 (YMMV)
- To get it working I had to install JDK 7 from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html
- Then edit the IntelliJ config file at /Applications/IntelliJ IDEA 14.app/Contents/Info.plist, setting:
```
<key>JVMVersion</key>
<string>1.7</string>
```

# Implementing a game

- The game library itself is under core/src/katsu.
- Each game has its own:
    - implementation package e.g. core/src/ld32 is my LD32 entry
    - resources folder e.g. core/assets/ld32/...
    - desktop launcher e.g. desktop/src/ld32/LD32Runner
        - this is set as the main class in build.gradle
        - the launcher must pass an instance of your implementation of KGame which is responsible for implementation specific details (level manager, sounds, settings and so on - the LD32 implementation hopefully shows what's needed here).

# Credits & License

# TODO

- [x] review changes to framework during LD33 to check stuff that needs cleaning
- [ ] support overriding KUI - move out LD33 specific logic to LD33UI class
- [ ] try to remove static stuff where possible
- [ ] review LD33 impl code for useful stuff to move to framework
