# Katsu - Game Framework built on LibGDX

This is my personal library used to get a quick start for my Ludum Dare entries.
It's evolved over time based on my needs during the compos. The project structure was originally generated by LibGDX (Gradle).

Enjoy, and good luck! ~ berkano (http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/berkano/)

# Implementing a game

- The game library itself is under core/src/katsu.
- Each game has its own:
    - implementation package e.g. core/src/ld28 is my LD28 entry
    - resources folder e.g. core/assets/ld28/...
    - desktop launcher e.g. desktop/src/ld28/DesktopLauncher
        - this is set as the main class in build.gradle
        - the launcher must pass an instance of your implementation of KatsuGame which is responsible for implementation specific details (level manager, sounds, settings and so on - the LD28 implementation hopefully shows what's needed here).
