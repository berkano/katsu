*** Katsu - Game Framework built on LibGDX ***

- This is my personal library used to get a quick start for my Ludum Dare entries.
- It's evolved over time based on my needs during the compos.
- /!\ Code quality warning /!\ Most of the code was written during the compos, though I do go back and try to refactor things in the run up to a new compo.
- It is in no way a serious project (really, it's to fulfil the rules of the compo) but I have made some effort to make it re-usable in the hope it's useful for someone else - over time perhaps more so :-)
- The project structure was originally generated by LibGDX (Gradle). It's probably a good idea to (a) familiarise yourself with their project generator and get that working, and (b) read up a bit on LibGDX before jumping in.
- It only targets desktop these days.

 Enjoy, and good luck! ~ berkano (http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/berkano/)

*** Implementing a game ***

- The game library itself is under core/src/katsu.
- Each game has its own:
    - implementation package e.g. core/src/ld28 is my LD28 entry
    - resources folder e.g. core/assets/ld28/...
        - You'll want to delete the other ones before distributing a jar otherwise it will also contain these assets and add to the file size. I kept my LD28 entry in there as a reference while creating new games.
    - desktop launcher e.g. desktop/src/ld28/DesktopLauncher
        - this is set as the main class in build.gradle
        - the launcher must pass an instance of your implementation of KatsuGame which is responsible for implementation specific details (level manager, sounds, settings and so on - the LD28 implementation hopefully shows what's needed here).
