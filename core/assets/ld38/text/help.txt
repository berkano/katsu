[GREEN]~Movement and Selection~[WHITE]
  * Click a Troll to select it.
  * Tell a Troll to go somewhere by clicking a point on the map.
  * Click a Troll a second time to de-select it (when no Troll is
    selected you can inspect any object on the map by clicking it).

[GREEN]~Actions~[WHITE]
  * Pressing Space carries out an action such as Mine, Eat Mushroom,
    Eat Fish, etc. depending on where the Troll is standing.
  * Mining allows a Troll to gather Stone and Gold (see details
    below), but also risks an encounter with a Monster!
  * If a Troll gets tired of Mining it may demand some Fish.
  * Trolls are afraid of Water, so in order for them to swim to a
    fishing ground, they need to eat a Psychedelic Mushroom for
    courage.
  * Mushrooms can be planted on Mud patches. Once a mushroom is
    fully grown it can be eaten by a Troll.

[GREEN]~Mining, Resources & Building~[WHITE]
  * Mining allows the Trolls to gather Stone and Gold.
  * These are used to build the Troll Castle (which is the objective
    of the game).
  * The status bar at the top of the screen shows how much Stone and
    Gold the Trolls have, as well as the progress towards building
    the Troll Castle.
  * Walls must be built first - completely covering the yellow Sand
    square. After that, a Tower must be built on each corner.
    Finally, each Tower can be upgraded to a Gold Tower by pressing
    Space. This completes the Castle and the game.
